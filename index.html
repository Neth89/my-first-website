<b>Hi there fellow human! I know there are a ton of interesting things you can read online but somehow you landed on my bio. You’ve already read this far in so you might as well read some interesting facts about me. First let me introduce myself! My name is Solina Neth. I was born and raised in Modesto, California. Modesto is a town where the famous director George Lucas was born and that’s pretty much the only interesting fact about my home town. Unless, you think watching bum fights at your local park interesting, then Modesto might just peak your interest. <br>
<br>I am now living in Anaheim, California but the locals here call in Anacrime, California. I am currently a student of life and a student of coding at UCI. So far I’ve learned that if you feel incompetent throughout the course then you’re on the right track to success. I’m not too sure about that motto but I’m going to be pat myself on the back because I feel horribly incompetent. Anyways, I love long walks on the beach, Netflix, and I’m always down to try new foods. I think that’s enough information for you to decide if you want to be my friend. If not then I will settle for an acquaintance too. I hope you enjoyed wasting your time reading about me!</b>
