        Hello my name is Solina Neth! Just in case you want to be my friend there are things you need to know. I was born and raised in the most boring Modesto, California. There is literally nothing to do there. I love exploring new places, which is why I moved to Los Angeles county. I've been living here for about five years and absolutely love it! I love the food around here and will eat almost anything.
